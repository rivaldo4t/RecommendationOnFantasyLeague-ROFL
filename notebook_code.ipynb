    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Soccer is one of the most followed games in the world, and English Premier League(EPL) is highest earning, most competitive and most watched sports league. As soccer lovers, this experience extends beyond viewing the game and participating in Fantasy Premier Leagues and even betting, which may or may not include monetary transactions.\n",
    "The popularity of FPL can be judged from the fact that more than 4 million people in Britain itself play the league annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fantasy football is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life footballers and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. The fantasy football league ask participants to select 15 players within a price budget, with the combination of 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. The game is run over 38 gameweeks, where each gameweek comprises of 10 matches of 20 teams. The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible. The scoring is done based on some factors, like, player appearance, goals scored, assists, clean sheets, penalties, wins. The scoring is adversely affected if goals are scored against the team, yellow or red card received, penalty misses, own goals and loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/EPL-1.jpg\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "As soccer fans and budding data scientists, we plan to tackle the problem of selecting players in an optimal and unbiased way. Most people, around the world, place bets based on emotions, expert advice or player popularity. At best, they consider past performances or statistics to find the optimal bet. We plan to build a recommender engine that ranks the players of different categories(Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper) and lets the user build his own team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our motivation of this project is to help soccer fans make informed decisions. Since our algorithms has no biases towards players, it helps bring relatively unknown players who are performing very well into limelight. This is due to the fact that we take into consideration unique features. "

    "\n",
    "Current tools provide specific functionalities like customized transfer recommendations, points, projections, etc. using past statistics but most of them require a subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related work include Fantasy Football Fix(https://www.fantasyfootballfix.com/), which has features like predicting which players will change in value and when, showing player points projects based on past statistics. The work suffers from the drawback that the onus is on user to create his own team and try out different team combinations based on points predicted and optimizations suggested. \n",
    "Fantasy Football Geek(http://www.fantasyfootballgeek.co.uk/) and Scout(https://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/) post news, tips and tricks, player rankings, game analysis, etc based on expert opinions but do not provide actual recommendations that our project aims to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project provides recommendations based on players data from recent and past performances. We provide recommendations on different categories, like top 10 attackers, defenders, midfielders and goalkeepers, which will help the user to build his own team. Unlike other subscription based solutions, we aim to make our project free for all soccer fans. By providing recommendations in each category, we provide a simplistic and easy to use solution for everyone. These differences certainly prove to be beneficial to users. "

    "1. Dataset for season 2016-17 has been obtained from https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League/tree/master/data/2016-17. Current Season data is scraped from Fantasy Premier League website. Dataset includes both explicit and implicit features for each player. Explicit features are assists, goals scored, saves, passes completed, etc while implicit features cover player's bonus points, influence, creativity and threats. The dataset also covers player's past seasons history. Dataset for past season(2016-17) and (2017-18) contains gameweek wise scores and features for player. b 2. Player position and team data has been taken from FoxSports. \n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges:\n",
    "1. Fantasy premier league website only provides the current data of the players. Extracting the data for past seasons was quite challenging. Any single source of data didn't suffice, due to which we had to extract data from multiple sources providing information of different Features for players like Teams and Positions.\n",
    "2. Player name different and contained special characters, had to be handled. \n",
    "3. Understanding and tuning features for each category of players, for example, for forward position we considered features like goals scored and assists as most important features. Features like ict index, which is a combination of player's influence, creativity and threat also play a major role in player ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In future, our model can be extended to provide complete manager module, which can recommend optimal players in case of:\n",
    "1. Substitutions - In the game which three players can be substituted to optimize the team\n",
    "2. Injuries - In case of injuries, who is the most \"similar\" player to replace the injured player\n",
    "3. Transfers - which player(s) from other teams can be bought to improve the team performance in the future season\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in future we plan to use neural models and deep learning to learn hidden features and analyse their effects on precision of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open issues:\n",
    "1. Dataset is only available for 2016-17 season, for better results more data is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Since we are predicting the player features to be the average of his last 5 games, if a player is not even participating even in a gameweek, our model still gives points to the player assuming the player will appear in the game, leading to inaccurate results. Somehow, the model needs to know whether the player would play or not in the next gameweek.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The model does not consider any injuries, suspensions the player might have, and gives results assuming that the players who started in the season continue to play the entire season. Although since our algorithm takes into account player's current trend, if a player is not playing continuously for last games, automatically his predicted performance decreases.\n"
