    "# Introduction\n",
    "Introduction / problem background / motivation -- what is the research question? Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Soccer is one of the most followed games in the world, and English Premier League(EPL) is highest earning, most competitive and most watched sports league. As soccer lovers, this experience extends beyond viewing the game and participating in Fantasy Premier Leagues and even betting, which may or may not include monetary transactions.\n",
    "The popularity of FPL can be judged from the fact that more than 4 million people in Britain itself play the league annually.\n",
    "Fantasy football is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life footballers and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. The fantasy football league ask participants to select 15 players within a price budget, with the combination of 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. The game is run over 38 gameweeks, where each gameweek comprises of 10 matches of 20 teams. The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible. The scoring is done based on some factors, like, player appearance, goals scored, assists, clean sheets, penalties, wins. The scoring is adversely affected if goals are scored against the team, yellow or red card received, penalty misses, own goals and loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As soccer fans and budding data scientists, we plan to tackle the problem of selecting players in an optimal and unbiased way. Most people, around the world, place bets based on emotions, expert advice or player popularity. At best, they consider past performances or statistics to find the optimal bet. We plan to build a recommender engine that ranks the players of different categories(Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper) and lets the user build his own team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our motivation of this project is to help soccer fans make informed decisions. Since our algorithms has no biases towards players, it helps bring relatively unknown players who are performing very well into limelight. This is due to the fact that we take into consideration unique features. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "English Premier League based Fantasy League engages users worldwide to be a part of the online competition. Users based on their own choices of players form a fantasy team and compete to stay on the top. Players statistics reflect performance and form and are crucial for earning high points in the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "Earning highest points in the game is quite a challenging task. It is quite subjective and even hard for users competing in the game to predict. Our project is an initiative to tackle this problem and help users make better judgements by providing a Ranking for Top Players. We plan to use player statistics hold a lot of insight on the player’s current form. This insight is relevant to not only forming the team but also make the substitutions ahead of a game week. "

We provide recommendations on different categories, like top 10 attackers, defenders, midfielders and goalkeepers, which will help the user to build his own team.

By providing recommendations in each category, we provide a simplistic and easy to use solution for everyone. These differences certainly prove to be beneficial to users. \n"

    "\n",
    "Challenges:\n",
    "1. Fantasy premier league website only provides the current data of the players. Extracting the data for past seasons was quite challenging. Any single source of data didn't suffice, due to which we had to extract data from multiple sources providing information of different Features for players like Teams and Positions.\n",
    "2. Plyaer name different and contained special characters, had to be handled. \n",
    "3. Understanding and tuning features for each category of players, for example, for forward position we considered features like goals scored and assists as most important features. Features like ict index, which is a combination of player's influence, creativity and threat also play a major role in player ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Do next:\n",
    "In future, our model can be extended to provide complete manager module, which can recommend optimal players in case of:\n",
    "1. Substitutions - In the game which three players can be substituted to optimize the team\n",
    "2. Injuries - In case of injuries, who is the most \"similar\" player to replace the injured player\n",
